ADAM'S RANDOM ITEM GENERATOR ‚Äî USER GUIDE
=========================================

SUPPORTED LIST TYPES
--------------------

This tool supports two types of lists based on the first column's header in your Excel file:

1. WEAPON LIST
2. VEHICLE LIST

The program will automatically detect which logic to use based on the first column header.

================================================================================
‚öîÔ∏è WEAPON LIST LOGIC
================================================================================

EXPECTED EXCEL FORMAT:
| Column A (Weapon Name) | Column B (Modifiers 1) | Column C (Modifiers 2) |

RULES:
- If the weapon name includes "(melee only)":
  ‚Üí Pull modifiers ONLY from Column C (Modifiers 2)

- If the weapon name does NOT include "(melee only)":
  ‚Üí Pull modifiers ONLY from Column B (Modifiers 1)

- Number of modifiers per item:
  ‚Üí If the "Random Modifiers" toggle is ON, select a random number between 1 and 3
  ‚Üí If the toggle is OFF, use the number specified in the "Modifiers per Item" field

================================================================================
üöó VEHICLE LIST LOGIC
================================================================================

EXPECTED EXCEL FORMAT:
| Column A (Vehicle Name) | Column B (Modifiers) | Column C (One-Use Modifiers) |

RULES:
- If the vehicle name includes "(one use)":
  ‚Üí Pull modifiers ONLY from Column C (One-Use Modifiers)

- If the vehicle name does NOT include "(one use)":
  ‚Üí Pull modifiers ONLY from Column B (Standard Modifiers)

- Number of modifiers per item:
  ‚Üí If the "Random Modifiers" toggle is ON, select a random number between 1 and 3
  ‚Üí If the toggle is OFF, use the number specified in the "Modifiers per Item" field

================================================================================
‚ú≥Ô∏è ASTERISK MODIFIER RULE
================================================================================

This rule applies to BOTH weapon and vehicle lists:

- Modifiers that begin with an asterisk (*) are treated as exclusive.
- If one *modifier is chosen for an item, NO OTHER *modifiers will be added to that item.
- Only one *modifier is allowed per item.
- In the output, the asterisk (*) will be hidden for a cleaner look.

================================================================================
üéØ ANTI-MODIFIER RANDOMIZATION RULE
================================================================================

This rule applies if the "Random Anti-Modifiers" toggle is turned ON:

- Any modifier that starts with "Anti-" will be affected.
  ‚Üí If it already includes a value like (4+), that number will be replaced with a random number between 1 and 6.
  ‚Üí If it does NOT include a value, a random (2‚Äì5)+ will be appended.

EXAMPLES:
- "Anti-Character (4+)" ‚Üí "Anti-Character (2+)"
- "Anti-Vehicle" ‚Üí "Anti-Vehicle (5+)"
